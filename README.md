# Position-mapping-Lol

A simple script for experimenting with mapping champion positions from the League of Legends minimap to their actual game positions.

## What it does

This is a personal playground script that helps visualize and configure different areas of the LoL minimap:
- Lane detection (Top, Mid, Bot)
- Jungle quadrants 
- River areas
- Base locations

## Usage

1. Place your minimap image as `minimap.png` in the project folder
2. Run the script: `python pos.py`
3. Click on the minimap to see position classifications
4. Adjust parameters interactively through the console to fine-tune area detection

Just a fun little tool to mess around with position mapping concepts!
